# ImportSplineCSVg
Import Splines from CSV to Autodesk Fusion (globalized)

Unlike the standard Autodesk's sample script, this import respects alternative data delimiters in CSV files (Czech, German), can import multiple profiles in one go (delimited by an empty line in the CSV file), allows comma as a decimal separator, and allows to import X/Y-only CSV files.
